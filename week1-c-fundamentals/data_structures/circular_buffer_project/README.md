# Circular Buffer Project

## Description
This project implements a circular buffer for `sensor_data_t`:
- Enqueue and dequeue sensor data
- Print all data
- Check if buffer is full/empty

## Key Features
- Fixed-size buffer with automatic overwrite
- Comprehensive error handling
- Non-destructive peek operation
- Memory-efficient array implementation

## Dependencies
- Requires `sensor_data.h` and `sensor_data.c` from the `sensor_data_project`
- Include these files in your project to compile and run the circular buffer project

## Notes
- Make sure the `sensor_data_project` files are accessible in your project
- Tested with GCC / standard C compiler
